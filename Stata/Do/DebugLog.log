. 
. * Format: [rowname_center] --> [rowname_left] - Connect a center block to a left block for horizontal arrows across rows.
.         * [rowname_center] --> [rowname_center] - Connect a center block to a center block for vertical across within the same column for blocks in the center.
.         * [rowname_left] --> [rowname_left] - Connect a left block to a left block for vertical across within the same column for blocks on the left.
.         * , angled - This option makes the arrow make a 90 degree angle. Use this across a blank row.
. * Column Orientation: 
. * The sides of the diagram are initially counter-intuitive. Think of it like reading a chest x-ray: when interpreting the x-ray the patient's left is on the right of the page and the patient's right is on the left of the page -- the orientation being
. *       relative to a patient facing out of the plane of the x-ray. Likewise, the column that is immediately to the left of the page as the center column and the column that is immediately to the right of the page is the left column.
. *       Connect each row's block with an underscore and then the column-orientation corresponding to its side in this manner.
