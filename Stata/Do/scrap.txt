"rblock_row2" 33 "This is another row, of a block" "rblock_row3" 44 "This is another row, of a block"

* Example of usage with lines broken for clarification:
flowchart_writeblock row: /// 
	* Left Block
	"lblock1_row1" 46 "This is one row, of a block." /// 
	"lblock1_row2" 43 "This is another row, of a block" /// 
	"lblock1_row3" 3 "This is another row, of a block", ///
	* Right Block
	"rblock1_row1" 97 "This is one row, of a block." ///
	"rblock1_row2" 33 "This is another row, of a block" ///
	"rblock1_row3" 44 "This is another row, of a block"

* With rowname specified:
flowchart_writeblock row(row_name): "lblock1_row1" 46 "This is one row, of a block." "lblock1_row2" 43 "This is another row, of a block" "lblock1_row3" 3 "This is another row, of a block", "rblock1_row1" 97 "This is one row, of a block." "rblock1_row2" 33 "This is another row, of a block" "rblock1_row3" 44 "This is another row, of a block"

* Note: A single row = a left block and a right block. A single ',' divides the left block from the right block. Each block consists of a collection of lines. A single line has a description and number (n=#) associated with it. 
* If there is only 1 line, it is centered. If there are more than one line, the first line is the leading line and the others are enumerated and indented.
